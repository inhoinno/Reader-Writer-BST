This project is a personal extend study of DKU Operating System lecture, Professor Jongmoo Choi.<br> 
![Coarse-grain Reader-Writer lock in Writer Only Workload](./img/CG.png)
In a nutshell, mutex based semaphore rw-lock contension overhead much higher than a single mutex CG. <br>
For future study, fine-grain & low overhead rw-lock should be implemented<br>
